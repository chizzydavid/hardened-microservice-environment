1. Incident commander name:
    Chizindu David

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
   A set of crypto mining pods were launched into the cluster. Attackers seeking compute resource gained illicit access into the system and set up 3 monero containers: minergate, moneropool and xmrpooldotnet. 
   Our Falco Monitoring Dashboard enabled us detect and visualize this suspicous activity promptly

3. Summary of what was affected:
    CPU resources were significantly depleted during this period. The graphs showed a huge spike in CPU usage.

4. Summary of the impact:
   This unfortunate incident exposes security vulnerabilities within the system.
   Several applications experienced scaling issues due to depleted CPU resources

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
    On detecting the attack on the Falco Dashboard, the following command was run
    kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force 
    The command forcefully kills the crypto pod and evicts it. 
    After this, the falco dashboard is again monitored to confirm CPU utilization becoming stabilized

6. Summary of lessons learned:
    Higher priority should be placed on monitoring and alerting, particularly falco alerts for key metrics.
    The attackers deployed the containers by executing kubectl commands, this indicates they have access to an administrative terminal and/or kubeconfig file. 
    A review should be carried out across the team to see who has been compromised.
    Using Admission Controllers, restrictions could also be placed on the images allowed or supported within the cluster.
